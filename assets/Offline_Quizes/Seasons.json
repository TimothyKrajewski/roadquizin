      "D": "5",
      "answer": "C",
      "funFact": "There are four seasons: spring, summer, fall (autumn), and winter. The seasons are caused by Earth's tilt on its axis as it orbits the Sun."

      "answer": "B",
      "funFact": "Seasons are caused by Earth's tilt on its axis (about 23.5 degrees) as it orbits the Sun, not by Earth's distance from the Sun. When the Northern Hemisphere tilts toward the Sun, it's summer there."
