        "B": "Red, yellow, blue",
        "C": "Cyan, magenta, yellow",
        "D": "A fictional battle",
        "answer": "A",
        "funFact": "Primary colors depend on the color model: red, yellow, blue for pigments (subtractive); red, green, blue for light (additive/RGB); cyan, magenta, yellow for printing (CMYK)."

        "question": "What color do you get when you mix red and blue?",
        "A": "Green",
        "B": "Purple",
        "C": "Orange",
        "D": "Brown",
        "answer": "B",
        "funFact": "Mixing red and blue creates purple (or violet). In the subtractive color model (paints), red and blue are primary colors that combine to make secondary colors."

        "question": "What color do you get when you mix all the colors of light?",
        "A": "Black",
        "B": "White",
        "C": "Gray",
        "D": "Brown",
        "answer": "B",
        "funFact": "When you mix all colors of light (additive color mixing), you get white light. This is different from mixing paints, where all colors create black or brown."

        "question": "What is the complementary color of red?",
        "A": "Blue",
        "B": "Green",
        "C": "Yellow",
        "D": "Purple",
        "answer": "B",
        "funFact": "Green is the complementary color of red. Complementary colors are opposite each other on the color wheel and create strong contrast when placed together."

        "question": "What color is associated with stop signs and fire trucks?",
        "A": "Red",
        "B": "Yellow",
        "C": "Orange",
        "D": "Blue",
        "answer": "A",
        "funFact": "Red is associated with stop signs and fire trucks because it's highly visible and attention-grabbing. Red light has the longest wavelength in the visible spectrum."

        "C": "Purple",
        "D": "Brown",
        "answer": "B",
        "funFact": "Mixing yellow and blue creates green. In the subtractive color model, yellow and blue are primary colors that combine to make the secondary color green."

        "A": "Blue",
        "B": "White",
        "C": "Gray",
        "D": "Purple",
        "answer": "A",
        "funFact": "The sky appears blue because of Rayleigh scattering - shorter blue wavelengths of light are scattered more by air molecules than longer red wavelengths."

        "question": "What color is associated with nature and growth?",
        "A": "Blue",
        "B": "Green",

        "D": "Brown",
        "answer": "B",
        "funFact": "Green is associated with nature and growth because it's the color of most plants. Chlorophyll, the pigment that makes plants green, is essential for photosynthesis."

        "answer": "B",
        "funFact": "Warm colors are red, orange, and yellow - they're associated with warmth, energy, and excitement. Cool colors (blue, green, purple) are associated with calm and tranquility."

        "D": "Brown",
        "answer": "C",
