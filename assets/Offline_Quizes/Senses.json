        "D": "More than 5",
        "answer": "D",
        "funFact": "While the traditional five senses are sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch, humans actually have more senses, including balance, temperature, pain, and proprioception (body position)."

        "C": "The Battle of the Somme (World War I)",
        "D": "There are only 4",
        "answer": "A",
        "funFact": "The five traditional senses are sight (vision), hearing (sound), taste (flavor), smell (scent), and touch (feeling). These are the basic ways we perceive the world."

        "D": "Skin",
        "answer": "B",
        "funFact": "The eyes are the organs used for sight. They detect light and convert it into electrical signals that the brain interprets as images."

        "question": "What organ is used for hearing?",
        "A": "Eyes",
        "B": "Ears",

        "D": "Mouth",
        "answer": "B",
        "funFact": "The ears are the organs used for hearing. They detect sound waves and convert them into electrical signals that the brain interprets as sounds."

        "question": "What organ is used for taste?",
        "A": "Nose",
        "B": "Tongue",
        "C": "Ears",
        "D": "Eyes",
        "answer": "B",
        "funFact": "The tongue is the organ primarily used for taste, with taste buds that can detect five basic tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami."

        "question": "What organ is used for smell?",
        "A": "Mouth",

        "C": "Ears",
        "D": "Eyes",
        "answer": "B",
        "funFact": "The nose is the organ used for smell. It contains olfactory receptors that detect chemicals in the air and send signals to the brain."

        "C": "Skin",
        "D": "Nose",
        "answer": "C",
        "funFact": "The skin is the largest sense organ, covering the entire body. It's responsible for the sense of touch and also helps detect temperature and pain."

        "B": "4",
        "C": "5",
        "D": "6",
        "answer": "C",
        "funFact": "Humans can detect five basic tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami (savory). Different parts of the tongue are sensitive to different tastes."

        "question": "What sense is closely linked to memory?",
        "A": "Sight",
        "B": "Smell",
        "C": "Hearing",
        "D": "Taste",
        "answer": "B",
        "funFact": "Smell is closely linked to memory because the olfactory system is directly connected to the brain's memory and emotion centers. Scents can trigger vivid memories."

    {
        "question": "What sense helps us maintain balance?",
        "A": "Sight",
        "B": "Hearing",
        "C": "Touch",
        "D": "Vestibular sense",
        "answer": "D",
        "funFact": "The vestibular sense (located in the inner ear) helps us maintain balance and sense our body's position and movement in space. It works with vision and proprioception."
